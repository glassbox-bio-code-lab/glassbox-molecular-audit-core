  "mechanism_of_action": "Selective ATP-competitive inhibition of the BCR‑ABL1 tyrosine kinase, stabilizing the inactive conformation of ABL1 and suppressing oncogenic signaling.",

  "evidence_positive": [
    "ABL1 is the reviewed UniProt target P00519; BCR‑ABL1 fusions drive CML signaling [UniProt ABL1].",
    "Population-level adoption of imatinib as first line associated with marked survival gains and deep molecular responses [trial/observational synthesis].",

    "Emergent kinase domain mutations (e.g., T315I) confer resistance; requires sequencing and TKI switch or allosteric/combination strategies [mutation/resistance]."
